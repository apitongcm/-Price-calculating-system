#  Price-calculating-system is the my output while studying in the lesson of prototypes, functions and array. 
#  This system given with the prices inside the array. 
#  It will add to the array of each element the 12% E-Vat tax in the philippines. 
#  I also added a function that will be able to add the price incase there will be an price hike for the entire array. 
#  I also added another function that will solve for the incentives you will received if all the items in the array  will be sold.
#  And Lastly, I added all the incentives to get the sum of the total incentives I'll be getting if all the items are sold.
